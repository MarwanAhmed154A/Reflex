# Reflex – C++ Reflection System

Reflex is a lightweight, header-only C++ reflection system with zero external tools, no friend hacks, and a minimal setup:
→ just two lines of code per class.

Features:

* Reflect private/protected/public members

* Works purely at runtime time using static initialization

* No build step, and no code generation

* Simple API for introspection, metadata, and runtime usage
---
**Integration:

Just include the Reflex header files in your project. No external dependencies.
